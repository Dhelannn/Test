Hello I'm Dhelan and I made Console X! -
-
What's Console X?
-
Console X is a script made to give you access to the Developer Command Bar in Console (/Console) that let's you execute Scripts/Codes in the Command Bar. 
-
If you hate your Executor's UI and Love Developer Console UI or just want to Look like a "Real Hacker and not an Exploiter" then I recommend using my Script
-
Also support me by Liking Console X and Favoriting Console X in Scriptblox! 
-
Also if you want some suggestions and improvements in the Script feel free to comment those in 
-
(I'll also try updating this script in my free time and try adding more things like better Execution and more, So stay tuned! )
